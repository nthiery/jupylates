## Abstract

Jupyter based environments are getting a lot of traction for teaching
computing, programming, and data sciences. The narrative structure of
notebooks has indeed proven its value for guiding each student at
their own pace to the discovery and understanding of new concepts or
new idioms (e.g. how do I extract a column in pandas?). But then these
new pieces of knowledge tend to quickly fade out and be
forgotten. Indeed long term acquisition of knowledge and skills takes
reinforcement by repetition. This is the foundation of many online
learning platforms like Webwork or WIMS that offer exercises with
randomization and automatic feedback. And of popular "AI-powered" apps
-- e.g. to learn foreign languages -- that use spaced repetition
algorithms designed by educational and neuro sciences to deliver just
the right amount of repetition.

What if you could author such exercizes as notebooks, to benefit from
everything that Jupyter can offer (think rich narratives,
computations, visualization, interactions)? What if you could
integrate such exercises right into your Jupyter based course? What if
a learner could get personalized exercise recommandations based on
their past learning records, without having to give away these
sensitive pieces of information away?

That's Jupylates (work in progress). And thanks to the open source
scientific stack, it's just a small Jupyter extension.

In this talk, we will first briefly review our usage of Jupyter for
teaching at Université Paris-Saclay, to motivate how we came to
develop Jupylates. Then, after a quick demo, we will discuss its
design, describe its current and upcoming features, and report on its
usage in two large freshmen classes in 2023-2024.

Time permitting, we will zoom out and deliver a brief tour of our
Jupyter course infrastructure, advertising in particular Travo for
GitLab-based nbgrader-compatible assignment management.

## Jupylates at a glance

### Context

:::{admonition} Using Jupyter at Paris-Saclay since 2017 

- for **teaching at scale** computation and data (and programming)  
  600 first year students, 4k users

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{hint} Great for **telling stories** 🥳

- fine grained scenarization of **interactive activities** :  
  read, try, apply, get feedback and tips, pause, experiment, explore, take notes, etc.
- **engages students** to explore the material each at their own pace
- **effective** to take them by the hand to **discover** new concepts or idioms

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{error} Failure 😭
- as quickly as they discover, they forget
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} No surprise
- long term acquisition takes some amount of repetition
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} Questions 🤔

- could we do that within Jupyter?
- with just the right amount of repetition (adaptative)?
- with variations?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

:::{admonition} Exerciser
- 😀 lets the student **repeat** an exercise, with **randomization**
- 😀 **very simple model**: an exercise =
  - code + prose + lightweight annotations (`hidden-cell`, `hidden-input`, `hidden-output`, `substitution`, `answer`, `test`)
  - authored as (text) notebooks, with tags
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} Exercise navigator
- 😀 with **recommendation** and **spaced repetition** ({abbr}`WIP (Work In Progress)`)  
  thanks to collecting and exploiting **local learning records**

:::{admonition} Jupyter based
😀 **language agnostic**  
🥳 rich **narrative**, **computations**, **visualizations**, (and **interactions**?)  
🎓 **easy to deploy** with **tight integration** into your course

### Use cases for Jupylates?

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} 👍 When your students use Jupyter anyway
- tight integration in your course
- easy to deploy: no external service, no licence, no vendor lock
- control on personal data
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} 👍 When you need bespoke computational exercises

- if you know how to write a notebook, you know how to write an exercise  
  crowdsource to your teaching team!
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} 👍 When you need rich computations or visualizations
- anything you can do in Jupyter, you can do in Jupylates (WIP)
- use your favorite, language, library, visualization, widgets, ...

% When you are part of a community

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} 👍 When you want to be {abbr}`FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)`

Promotes high value small, focused, portable, reusable learning units
- since 2014: ~100 C++ exercises ported from WIMS to PLaTon to JuPylates
- import / export (?) exercises from codex

A small step toward Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable ressources

## Future plans and vision

:::{admonition} Jupylates exerciser

1.  refine execution model and conventions  
    - for more generality
    - for {abbr}`DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)`er exercise sources
    - for displaying solutions
2.  reimplement as a JavaScript JupyterLab application to lift current limitations
    - support all notebook features: widgets, MyST, ...
    - use in Jupyterlite, Thebe, ...
	- integration in any notebook (currently Python only)
3.  safe exam mode
4.  testing tools, internationalisation, release, ...

### Vision: toward adaptative Jupyter/MyST courses

:::{admonition} A collaboration with the Kwarc group at FAU Nuremberg

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{hint} Strategy
- promote **semantic annotations** of the learning objects in the course material  
  e.g. this text chunk defines concept A; this other is an exercise applying A
- to let the computer **reason** about them
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} Immediate benefits
- rich course navigation: indexes, [hover-cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoverbox), better accessibility
- flashcards (e.g. with jupyter-cards)
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} Combined with learning records
-   **green lights** and **remediation**: am I ready to learn XXX? if not quite how can I make up for it?
-   **self-evaluation** and **drilling**: did I understand XXX right? make me rehearse!
-   **recommendation** and **guided tours**: what should I work on now?
-   ...
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

### Learning records

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{hint} Something to be said about **local learning records**

Ethical perspective:
- Most tools take learning records away from their users
- What about empowering user with them instead?

Practical perspective:
- No infrastructure needed
- No or minimal ethical concerns

An easy playground for experimentation!

:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

:::{admonition} Collect more learning records
- Collect random seeds and answers for reproducibility of past attempts
- Collect learning records from other Jupyter activities:
  - read that course unit
  - tried/failed/mastered that nbgrader exercise
  - drilled through these flashcards
  - qualitative self-evaluation
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

:::{admonition} From an exercise navigator to a course navigator
- progress dashboard
- green lights, drill sessions, and guided tours
- better recommendations and recommandations for other activities than Jupylates'
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

:::{admonition} Sharing learning records with instructors and researchers
- Record feedback and consent from the user
- dashboards for instructors
- data to train recommenders
- data for researchers
:::

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "fragment"}}

### Potential lines of research

- Is spaced repetition actually effective?
- What are the best recommendation strategies?
    - Does it depend on the kind of exercises?
    - Semantic AI + learner models? (takes annotation efforts)
    - vs Machine Learning with cohort data? (less local and private)
